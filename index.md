I'm a researcher at the Telekom Innovation Laboratories of Deutsche Telekom AG, based in Berlin.

My research interests are in the domain of Quality of Experience (QoE). I investigate how humans perceive multimedia, mostly targeting video and web services. In my studies, I run experiments with human subjects in order to predict QoE, user experience and user behavior. I have a diploma in computer science from the University of Vienna, and I am pursuing my PhD at the Ilmenau University of Technology.

You can contact me for consulting in video/audio transcoding issues, quality and usability testing, as well as integrating multimedia and web applications.
