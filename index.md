I am a researcher in the domain of *Quality of Experience* (QoE). I investigate how humans perceive multimedia, mostly targeting video streaming applications and web services.

I run laboratory and crowd-based experiments with humans in order to predict video quality, QoE, user experience, or user behavior.

Currently, I am a PhD student and researcher at the Ilmenau University of Technology in Germany. Before, I worked at Telekom Innovation Laboratories of Deutsche Telekom AG in Berlin, Germany. I have a diploma in computer science from the University of Vienna.

You can contact me for consulting in video/audio encoding, usage of popular multimedia tools, quality and usability tests, as well as integrating multimedia and web applications, especially when it's about streaming video.
