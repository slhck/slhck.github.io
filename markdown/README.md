## What is it?

This is a Markdown editor, which is based on [WMD](http://github.com/innocead/wmd), the editor from the [Stack Exchange](stackexchange.com) sites. It uses jQuery and the [jQuery Syntax Highlighter by balupton](http://balupton.com/projects/jquery-syntaxhighlighter).

You can see a live version of it [on my homepage](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/werner.robitza/markdown).
